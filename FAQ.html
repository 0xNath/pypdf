<h2><a id = 'license'>How is PyPDF2 licensed?</a></h2>
<p>Short answer:  BSD-style.  Do with PyPDF2 as you like, and 
   don't bring others down.

<p>Longer version:  ...
<h2><a id = 'why'>Why PyPDF2?  Why doesn't everyone everywhere just use libraries coded in Java or C?</a></h2>

<p>Why does PyPDF2 interest <i>you</i>?  The same or a similar reason
likely applies to other PyPDF2 users.  
<a href = 'mailto:PyPDF2@phaseit.net'>E-mail us</a> with a few words
about how <i>you</i> use PyPDF2.
           
<h2><a id = 'relation-to-pyPdf'>How is PyPDF2 related to pyPdf?</a></h2>

<p>As the <a href = 'http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/index.html#origin'>PyPDF2
   home page</a> explains, PyPDF2 is a fork from the no-longer-maintained pyPdf
   approved by the latter's founder.
          
<h2><a id = 'migration-from-pyPdf'>I'm a long-time pyPdf user.
How hard is migration to PyPDF2?</a></h2>

<p>Migration to PyPDF2 from pyPdf should be utterly transparent.
   If <i>anything</i> gets in your way, we want to know.  Your
   Python code needn't change <i>at all</i>, unless you choose
   to program in a customized location for the PyPDF2 module.
   In particular, ...
          
<h2><a id = 'more'>Where do I learn more about PyPDF2?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href = 'index.html'>PyPDF2 home page</a>
            is a good place to look for more information.
<h2><a id = 'mailing'>Is there a mailing list?</a></h2>

             
<h2><a id = 'comparisons'>How does PyPDF2 compare to [various competitors,
    complements, and so on]?</a></h2>
<p>As
    <a href = '#relation-to-pyPdf'>mention already</a>, PyPDF2 aims to
    be a strict successor of pyPdf:  it does everything pyPdf does,
    but it also does more.

    <p>Where ... deal with construction of PDF pages, PyPDF2 is largely
    about metadata:  PyPDF2 manages metadata, merges PDF instances,
    and so on.

<h2><a id = 'versions'>With what versions of Python does PyPDF2 work?</a></h2>

<p>As <a href = 'https://github.com/mstamy2'>Matthew</a> writes, 
    "<a href = 'https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/commit/24b270d876518d15773224b5d0d6c2206db29f64#commitcomment-5038317'>... the intention is for PyPDF2 to work with Python 2 as well as Python 3.</a>"

<p>In January 2014, the
  <a href = 'https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/tree/master'>main branch</a>
   works with 2.6-2.7 and 3.1-3.3 [and maybe 2.5?].  
   Notice that
   <a href = 'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPDF2/1.19'>1.19</a>--the
   <a href = 'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPDF2'>latest in PyPI</a>
    as of this writing--(mostly)
   did <i>not</i> work with 3.x.
                
<h2><a id = 'characteristic-problems'>
I often merge [concatenate] various PDF instances, and my
application 'craters' with certain files produced by
{AutoCAD, my departmental scanner, ...}, even though the
original files display OK.  What do I do now?

<p>Crucial ideas we want you to know:  <ul>
    <li><i>All</i> of us contend with 
    <a href = 'https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/issues/24'>this
    sort of thing</a>.  Vendors often produce PDF with questionable
    syntax, or at least syntax that isn't what PyPDF2 expects.
    <li>We're committed to resolving all these problems, so 
     that your applications (and ours) can handle any PDF 
     instances that come their way.  
     <a href = "mailto:PyPDF2@Phaseit.net">Write us</a> whenever you
     have a problem [describe the not-yet-working on-line
     submission system].
    <li>In the meantime, while you're waiting on us, you have 
        at least a couple of choices:  you can
        <ul>
        <li>debug PyPDF2 yourself; or
        <li>use Acrobat or Preview or a similar 
            consumer-grade PDF tool to 'mollify' [explain] your
            PDF instances so you get the results you
            are after.
        </ul>
    </ul>
