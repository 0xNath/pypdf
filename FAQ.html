<h2><a id = 'license'>How is PyPDF2 licensed?</a></h2>
<p>Short answer:  BSD-style.  Do with PyPDF2 as you like, and 
   don't bring others down.

<p>Longer version:  ...
<h2><a id = 'why'>Why PyPDF2?  Why doesn't everyone everywhere just use libraries coded in Java or C?</a></h2>

<p>Why does PyPDF2 interest <i>you</i>?  The same or a similar reason
likely applies to other PyPDF2 users.

about how <i>you</i> use PyPDF2.
           
<h2><a id = 'relation-to-pyPdf'>How is PyPDF2 related to pyPdf?</a></h2>

<p>As the <a href = 'http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/index.html#origin'>PyPDF2
   home page</a> explains, PyPDF2 is a fork from the no-longer-maintained pyPdf
   approved by the latter's founder.
          
<h2><a id = 'more'>Where do I learn more about PyPDF2?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href = 'index.html'>PyPDF2 home page</a>
            is a good place to look for more information.
<h2><a id = 'mailing'>Is there a mailing list?</a></h2>

             
<h2><a id = 'now'>What development is underway now?</a></h2>

             
<h2><a id = 'versions'>With what versions of Python does PyPDF2 work?</a></h2>

<p>The main branch [provide hyperlink] [what PyPI provides] as of
year-end 2013 works with 2.6-2.7
[and maybe 2.5?].  The 2-3 branch [] seems to do fine with 3.1-3.3 [?].
We're working to consolidate these, of course [although likely (?) at the
expense of 2.5?].
