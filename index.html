<h1>Home page for the PyPDF2 project</h1>

<p>In 2005, <a href = "http://mathieu.fenniak.net/">Mathieu Fenniak</a>
    launched
   <a href = "http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/"
      target = "pybrary">PyPdf</a> "as a PDF toolkit ..." focused on 
<ul>
<li>document manipulation:  by-page splitting, concatenation,
     and merging;</li>
<li>document introspection;</li>
<li>page cropping; and </li>
<li>document encryption and decryption.</li>
</ul>

   At the end of 2011, after consultation with Mathieu and others,
   <a href = "http://phaseit.net">Phaseit</a>
    sponsored <a href = "https://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a>
    as a fork of PyPdf on
    <a href = "#GitHub">GitHub</a>.  The initial impetus was to
    handle a wider range of input PDF instances; Phaseit's commercial
    work often encounters PDF instances "in the wild" that it needs to
    manage (mostly concatenate and paginate), but that deviate so much
    from PDF standards that PyPdf can't read them.   PyPDF2 reads a
    considerably wider range of real-world PDF instances. </p>

<p>Neither PyPdf nor PyPDF2 aims to be universal; 
   <a href = "http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.text.pdf/PDF_toolkits.html">here</a>
   are descriptions of other PDF libraries, including Python-based ones.

<p>[Compare PyPdf and PyPDF2.  Spelling.  Technical details:
    read; new functionality.]</p>

<p>[Explain documentation of PyPDF2.]</p>

<p>[Explain retrieval for the git-unaware.]</p>

<p>Plans for PyPDF2 include:
   <ul>
   <li>Web applications including an online PDF diagnostic tool;</li>
   <li>more complete documentation;</li>
   <li>[explain status of port to Python3;]</li>
   <li>PyPackaging;</li>
   <li>[... other ...].</li>

<h2><a id = "GitHub">Remarks on GitHub</a>

<p>In 2011, when Phaseit committed to long-term support of PyPDF2 as
   an open-source project, GitHub seemed the most advantageous host
   because of ...

<p>You can retrieve PyPDF2 sources even without GitHub familiarity or
