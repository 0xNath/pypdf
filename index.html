<h1>Home page for the PyPDF2 project</h1>

<p>In 2005, <a href = "http://mathieu.fenniak.net/">Mathieu Fenniak</a>
    launched
   <a href = "http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/"
      target = "pybrary">PyPdf</a> "as a PDF toolkit ..." focused on 
<ul>
<li>document manipulation:  by-page splitting, concatenation,
     and merging;</li>
<li>document introspection;</li>
<li>page cropping; and </li>
<li>document encryption and decryption.</li>
</ul>

   At the end of 2011, after consultation with Mathieu and others,
   <a href = "http://phaseit.net">Phaseit</a>
    sponsored <a href = "https://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a>
    as a fork of PyPdf on
    <a href = "#GitHub">GitHub</a>.  The initial impetus was to
    handle a wider range of input PDF instances; Phaseit's commercial
    work often encounters PDF instances "in the wild" that it needs to
    manage (mostly concatenate and paginate), but that deviate so much
    from PDF standards that PyPdf can't read them.   PyPDF2 reads a
    considerably wider range of real-world PDF instances. </p>

<p>Neither PyPdf nor PyPDF2 aims to be universal; 
   <a href = "http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.text.pdf/PDF_toolkits.html">here</a>
   are descriptions of other PDF libraries, including Python-based ones.

<p>[Compare PyPdf and PyPDF2.  Spelling.  Technical details:
    read; new functionality.]</p>

<p>Plans for PyPDF2 include:
   <ul>
   <li>Web applications including an <a href = "#online">online PDF diagnostic tool</a>;</li>
   <li>more complete <a href = '#documentation'>documentation</a>;</li>
   <li>[explain status of port to Python3;]</li>
   <li>PyPackaging [emphasize use with Zope/Plone [more references]];</li>
   <li>[... other ...].</li>
   </ul>
   Current plans for PyPDF2 do <i>not</i> include the ability to:
   <ul>
   <li>merge annotations;
   <li>...
   </ul>
   Let us know if you think these targets should change.

<p>The Reddit /r/python crowd <a href = "http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/qsvfm/pypdf2_updates_pypdf_pypdf2_is_an_opensource/"
                                 target = "Reddit">chatted</a> obliquely and briefly about
   PyPDF2 in March 2012.

<h2><a id = "online">Online demonstrations of PyPDF2</a></h2>
<p>Phaseit supports a couple of online PyPDF2 tools, including
     this live Web application which diagnoses ...

<h2><a id = "documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p><a href = "http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/pythondoc-pyPdf.pdf.html">PyPdf's
   documentation</a> applies; that is, PyPDF2 aims to be a strict superset
   of PyPdf, doing everything that PyPdf's documentation claims for 
   PyPdf, but also a bit more.

<p>What are the differences between the two libraries?  There are
   several cases where PyPdf tosses an (undocumented) exception,
   and PyPDF2 either provides a more descriptive exception, or 
   simply returns a correct result.

<p>PyPDF2 also extends PyPdf's application programming interface
   in quite a few regards [none of which we've yet documented ...].

<h2><a id = "GitHub">Remarks on GitHub</a></h2>

<p>In 2011, when Phaseit committed to long-term support of PyPDF2 as
   an open-source project, GitHub seemed the most advantageous host
   because of ...

<p>You can retrieve PyPDF2 sources even without GitHub familiarity or
   a GitHub account.  If you have a command-line git client, you 
   can simply write <code>git clone git://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2.git</code>,
   and copies of all the PyPDF2 sources will show up in the 
   <code>PyPDF2</code> directory (folder) of your current
   working directory (folder).  On Debian-derived hosts, installation
   of the client should be as easy as 
   <code>sudo apt-get install git-core</code>.  [Explain wget, Win* clients, ...]



<h2>Contact the PyPDF2 maintainers</h2>

<p>We welcome questions or comment about PyPDF2 through e-mail to
   <a href = "mailto:PyPDF2@Phaseit.net">PyPDF2@Phaseit.net</a>.
   Announcements about
   PyPDF2 occasionally appear by way of 
   <a href = "http://twitter.com/Phaseit/">Twitter</a>.

<p>Behind the scenes, PyPDF2 has an extensive collection of test
   scripts.  These are "behind the scenes" because many of the
   test instances are PDF files supplied by correspondents.  If
   PyPDF2 fails you in some way, please understand that you can
   send us all artifacts--files, scripts, and so on--necessary
   to reproduce the symptom, with confidence that we'll maintain
   your privacy.  That's how we are.
