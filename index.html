<h1>Home page for the PyPDF2 project</h1>

<p>In 2005, <a href = "http://mathieu.fenniak.net/">Mathieu Fenniak</a>
    launched
   <a href = "http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/"
      target = "pybrary">PyPdf</a> "as a PDF toolkit" focused on 
<ul>
<li>document manipulation:  by-page splitting, concatenation,
     and merging;</li>
<li>document introspection;</li>
<li>page cropping; and </li>
<li>document encryption and decryption.</li>
</ul>

   At the end of 2011, after consultation with Mathieu and others,
   <a href = "http://phaseit.net">Phaseit</a>
    sponsored <a href = "https://github.com/knowah/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a>
    as a fork of PyPdf.  The initial impetus was to
    handle a wider range of input PDF instances; Phaseit's commercial
    work often encounters PDF instances "in the wild" that it needs to
    manage (mostly concatenate and paginate), but that deviate so much
    from PDF standards that PyPdf can't read them.   PyPDF2 reads a
    considerably wider range of real-world PDF instances. </p>

<p>Neither PyPdf nor PyPDF2 aims to be universal; descriptions of
other PDF libraries, including Python-based ones appear ...

<p>[Compare PyPdf and PyPDF2.  Spelling.  Technical details.]</p>

<p>[Explain documentation of PyPDF2.]</p>

<p>Plans for PyPDF2 include:
   <ul>
   <li>Web applications including an online PDF diagnostic tool;</li>
   <li>more complete documentation;</li>
   <li>port to Python3;</li>
   <li>PyPackaging;</li>
   <li>[... other ...].</li>
   </ul>
